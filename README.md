# OPTICS clustering algorithm

### Data Mining and Data Wharehousing

*Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS)* is an algorithm for finding density-based clusters in spatial data. It was presented by Mihael Ankerst, Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel and JÃ¶rg Sander. Its basic idea is similar to DBSCAN, but it addresses one of DBSCAN's major weaknesses: the problem of detecting meaningful clusters in data of varying density.[^1]
